1. What is your assessment of Autodistribution’s chances for pan-European expansion?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I believe AutoDistributions should expand its reach beyond France. By bringing improvement in central organization through the elimination of back-office expenses and through better coordination of logistics. However, it should not be ignored that there is still a lot of domestic potential. Going international would help AutoDistributions to create a stronger brand. Comparing the most important markets for cars and aftermarket automotive parts shows that the needs are very similar in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Germany. 
* The German market is quite difficult, as high-end and mass car manufacturers dominate the market also for the aftermarket. OEMs have very strong brands, because of which companies such as AutoDistributions find it difficult to establish themselves. 
* The market in the UK is quite similar to France with a lot of small retailers, none of whom cover a significant market share, leaving a potential for AutoDistributions. 
* On the other hand, Spain has quite a strong automotive history which makes it an interesting market opportunity. In Spain, there are some competitors of AutoDistributions already operating in the market, but there is still high demand for more suppliers. 
* There is barely any tradition of professional repair shops in Italy from large OEMs or chains. The majority of repairs are made in family-owned small shops, so it is rather difficult to penetrate this market because large volumes are not needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"3. What rates of return do you expect for equity holders and each tranche of senior debt and subordinated debt for this investment given the forecasted financials and capital structure?
# Is this rate of return sufficient from Butler Capital’s perspective?
# Are the rates of return fair for the risks being taken from the perspective of the markets?
# You should consider the assumptions for margin improvements and growth in Exhibit 18 of the case in answering these questions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"4. For the previous question, suppose that Tranches A and B wanted to have total returns of 7.5% and 10.0%, respectively, in order to participate in this buyout.
# Adjust the structure of these tranches utilizing warrants and PIK bonds to achieve these returns. What are the resulting returns of the equity holders and the subordinated debt holders with your new financing structure?
# Suppose Butler Capital is targeting a return on all investments into its second fund that is 200 bps higher than they achieved in their first fund. Is it possible to structure the financing to achieve this along with the higher returns demanded by the Tranche A and B lenders? How?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5. What are the major risks associated with this investment? What can Butler and his team do to mitigate these risks? What and when is Butler’s likely exit from this deal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Butler Capital Partners and Autodistribution are exposed to several risks in their buyout deal like :
#The interest rate is too high; fees were required to be paid even if the buyout deal will end up  not being made. 
#Moreover, BNP required formalization of the working capital facility implying unnecessary cost for the company.
#Finally, the bank by one of its conditions forced upfront equity payments. More risks can arise from the internationalization strategy of AD. 
#In the other target markets (UK and Spain) the major threat is fierce competition, because other smaller companies are already operating in the market. Even for Italy there is risk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6. Should Butler submit a proposal for Autodistribution?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My recommendation to Butler Capital Partners would be to purchase Autodistribution. Since the automotive industry is expected to keep growing during the upcoming years, this opportunity appears to have growing potential from a market perspective. In addition, features like deregulation, aging car fleets, and especially fragmentation support our claim of market attractiveness. Talking about AD’s future outlook, I believe there is significant scope for margins increment via efficiency gains. I believe we can expect new gains from both the revenues and the cost sides. 
In terms of valuation, the rate of return that we have calculated is 28.5% which is close to the IRR that they are expecting. The annualized IRR in the 1999­-2006 period is lower than the minimum threshold established by the company (IRR=30%) which can be a reflection of our conservatis approach. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
